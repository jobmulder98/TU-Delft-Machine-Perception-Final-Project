README for the final assignment

This folder contains all needed files for the final assignment. To open the notebooks for the final
assignment, open the folder 
assignment --> 
	fa_00_overview.ipynb
	fa_01a_data_visualization.ipynb
	fa_02a_3d_pedestrian_detection_single_camera.ipynb
	fa_02b_mp_only_3d_pedestrian_detection_multiple_sensors.ipynb

The fourth notebook is for IV so it is empty.

NOTE: make sure the data folder (not added in the final-assignment.zip) is parallel to the release folder to load the sequence.

Thanks,
