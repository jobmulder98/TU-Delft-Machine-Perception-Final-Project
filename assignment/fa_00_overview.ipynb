    "### General announcements\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no groups for the final assignment. It's an _individual_ assessment.\n",
    "* Academic integrity is a high good at TU Delft. You need to sign the pledge above.\n",
    "* The assignment is part of the _assessment_, meaning that there is no longer an opportunity to ask questions about the contents on Brightspace or during the lab hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a strict deadline for the final assignment (see *Final Assignment* section below). You are responsible to ensure that you have submitted in time. So, please double check that your upload succeeded to Brightspace and that you uploaded the correct files. For late submissions, one grade point is subtracted per day (max. 2 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is possible to submit multiple versions of the final assignment. However, only your last submission is kept by Brightspace and will be graded. Note that re-submitting after the deadline activates the late-policy!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Only submit the `*.ipynb` files and nothing else.** ZIP files are not allowed and will be rejected by Brightspace.\n",
    "* **Also submit the practica 1, 2 and/or 3 `*.ipynb` files if you are reusing functions from those via `ipynb` imports.**\n",
    "* You can copy functions/code from your practica. In that case, please **mark the copied code as such** (via a comment). Reuse of code (e.g., via `ipynb` imports) is preferred over code duplication.\n",
    "* Your code must not use internet connection (to download files or similar).\n",
    "* Clear the output of your jupyter notebooks via (Cell $\\rightarrow$ All Output $\\rightarrow$ Clear), and save the notebook afterwards.\n",
    "* Submit your `release/*/*.ipynb` files in the course you are following. So in case of IV, submit your files on the IV Brightspace page. In case of MP, submit your files on the MP Brightspace page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* This [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) uses `nbgrader` to help us with automated tests. `nbgrader` will make various cells in this notebook \"uneditable\" or \"unremovable\" and gives them a special id in the cell metadata. This way, when we run our checks, the system will check the existence of the cell ids and verify the number of points and which checks must be run. While there are ways that you can edit the metadata and work around the restrictions to delete or modify these special cells, you should not do that since then our nbgrader backend will not be able to parse your notebook and give you points for the assignment. You are free to add additional cells, but if you find a cell that you cannot modify or remove, please know that this is on purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This notebook will have in various places a line that throws a `NotImplementedError` exception. These are locations where the assignment requires you to adapt the code! These lines are just there as a reminder for you that you have not yet adapted that particular piece of code, especially when you execute all the cells. Once your solution code replaced these lines, it should accordingly *not* throw any exceptions anymore. Any grading failure due to such reasons would be considered as a failure of that particular assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before you turn this problem in, make sure everything runs as expected. First, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All). Also **clear all outputs** from your cells before submitting (select Cell $\\rightarrow$ All Output $\\rightarrow$ Clear). Please **save the notebook** file afterwards (Ctrl+s, or File $\\rightarrow$ Save and Checkpoint)"

    "## Grading\n",
    "The number of points allotted to the questions more or less corresponds to the time effort involved.\n",

    "The final grade of this assignment will consist of the following (to some degree) independent criteria:\n",
    "- Concepts (~30%)\n",
    "  - Specification of intended solution\n",
    "  - Proactive reflection\n",
    "  - Interpretation of experimental results\n",

    "- Efficiency (~10%)\n",
    "  - Method complexity (efficiency of concept)\n",
    "  - Runtime (CPU run-time per frame)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For grading, we will run the assignment notebooks in lexicographical order.\n",
    "We expect each notebook to run from top to bottom without errors.\n",
    "Please stick to the (de)serialization code we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any programming task, we recommend to start implementing a basic concept and iteratively refining it, time permitting.\n",
    "You will be better off with a working implementation of a basic concept rather than with a fancy concept, which ends up non-working.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should visualize intermediate steps of your implementations to allow the graders to give you partial credit and ease the understanding of your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not spend more than the total time allocated (32 hours) for this final assignment!**\n",
    "One could spend a massive amount of time to develop truly advanced solutions, but this is neither expected nor will this be favorable in terms of cost-benefit.\n",
    "There are also other courses to attend to, and having a break in the holiday period is important to regenerate. "
